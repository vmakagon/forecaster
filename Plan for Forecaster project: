Plan for Forecaster project:

1. Github, branches
2. Write SQL request from BigQuery
3. Use Django, user registration, blog structure, white noise, statis file reindexing
4. Build model pipeline (Transformation, Imputer, NaNs, missing, columns transformation)
4.1 Use NN for prediction
4.2 Model Stacking
5. Grid search pipeline for the best model. model visualize (catboost like)
5.1 How we deal with NaN, missing values for each
5.2 generate new features
5.3 how we can test performance (time)
6. EDA. Feature importance.
6.1 strimlit (play around features)
7. Clusterization for coutry regions
8. Seasons. Global warming effect
9. Make map with rain predictions
9.1 Make predictions for each stations and regions (clusters)
9.2 Show on the map облачность.
10. API with REST API
11. Tensoboard with data distribution
12. Dask parrallel tech for tables and computation
13. Spark database
14. Generate data with same dist for providing experiments
15. Use real data to test results
16. Make a presentation
17. Update model after new dataloader (with xsl file) for other coutry/region

Questions:
1. Look for the best practice
